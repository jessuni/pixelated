# pixelated
Turn pixel art pngs to svgs with optimizing options, retaining original color and alpha channel. Options to convert into grayscaled vectors for the convenience of applying any color overlays later.

This tool is intended for small pixel icons, thus it's not optimized for all images. It might crash your browser if you insist on testing out other images, use at your own risk.
